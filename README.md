# Programming Projects

This project will be me attempting the various project ideas from a collection of the same. This is mainly for me to get some practice on making projects. Included in each project will be a .md file with my research notes into how to best go about starting each project. Do not expect coherency from these right now as they are mainly a way for me to jot down ideas & notes.

## Tests

Where applicable, once I have completed a project I will also include custom made tests. This will be a way for me to practice writing out my own custom tests.
